1. What Is Sensitive Data?
Sensitive data is any information that requires protection from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure because its release could cause harm to individuals, communities, institutions, or ecosystems. This need for protection may arise for legal, ethical, privacy, cultural, environmental, or intellectual-property reasons.
Although sensitive data is often associated with human-subject research, it is important to recognize that all disciplines produce sensitive data in different forms and at varying levels of risk. Sensitive data may involve social groups, organizations, wildlife, habitats, or proprietary technologies.
